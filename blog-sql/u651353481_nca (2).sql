(36, '1702561241.jpg', 'Angel Alvarez Cadavieco | Search Fund Leaders in the Field', 'Angel Alvarez Cadavieco, a former search fund entrepreneur and current NCA advisory board member, was one of the earliest pioneers of the search fund industry in Mexico and Latin America. As someone who helped pave the way for this asset class to take root and flourish, we are delighted to share Angel’s personal story and insights into the world of search funds.', 'angel-alvarez-cadavieco--search-fund-leaders-in-the-field', 1, 0, '<h2 style=\"margin-left:0px;\">IN SEARCH (AND ACQUISITION) OF SOMETHING MORE</h2><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\"><span style=\"background-color:transparent;font-size:14px;\">One could almost say that Angel Alvarez Cadavieco’s first foray into the world of search funds happened by chance. After working for four years in the corporate world of investment banking, M&amp;A, and private equity, Angel found himself craving something different in finance… but he wasn’t exactly sure what he was looking for. While pursuing a master’s degree in finance at London Business School, he attended a private equity club panel about search funds and discovered a whole new career possibility he had never heard of before, and an idea was born.</span></p><figure class=\"image image-style-side image_resized\" style=\"width:36.48%;\"><img style=\"aspect-ratio:768/1024;\" src=\"https://explorelogicsit.net/nca/portal/media/Angel_1-min-1-768x1024_1702561226.jpg\" width=\"768\" height=\"1024\"></figure><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\"><span style=\"background-color:transparent;font-size:14px;\">“It was just a perfect fit,” explained Angel. “My background in M&amp;A and private equity combined very well with the search fund model because, at the end of the day, the first piece of the process is to look for a great company and buy it, and that’s what I’d been doing for the past four years. But search funds also gave me the possibility of doing something more hands-on because, once you buy the business, you actually have an operating role leading the company. I was looking to get out of the huge corporate investment banking and private equity world and do something more operational and entrepreneurial. The search fund model combined everything that I was looking for.”</span></p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\"><span style=\"background-color:transparent;font-size:14px;\">Realizing he didn’t yet have the level of operational experience he needed as a young 26-year-old, who was fresh out of graduate school, and recognizing that he didn’t want to raise a search fund by himself, Angel returned to work at JP Morgan for another two years. But his dream of an entrepreneurial future never faded. Then at the end of 2012, together with partners Guillermo Zambrano and Jesus Lanza, Angel decided to launch a Mexico-based search fund (Lottus Capital), making him one of the first active searchers outside of the USA.</span></p><blockquote><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\"><span style=\"background-color:transparent;font-size:14px;\">“I believe we were the third or fourth search fund ever launched in Mexico and among the first few in all of Latin America,” said Angel. Breaking that kind of new ground certainly came with its own set of unique challenges. When Angel and his partners launched their search fund, there were very few search funds raised outside of the USA, and thus very few international investors who had experience investing in the asset class. “That meant we really had to rely on our own personal and professional network to raise our search fund,” Angel emphasized. “We knocked on a lot of doors. And we not only had to sell ourselves as potential CEOs and searchers, but before even doing that we had to explain the model and convince investors that the model works.”</span></p></blockquote><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\"><span style=\"background-color:transparent;font-size:14px;\">In addition to introducing investors to the concept of a search fund, and proving its value as an investment model, Angel’s team also had the difficult task of laying out all the legal foundations, structures, and documentation necessary to make their search fund a success. There were also very few people they could turn to for advice who had experience in the field. Starting from scratch proved to be a challenging, tedious, and time-consuming process. But Angel and his partners forged ahead into new territory as they kicked off their search across multiple industries. Over the next 21 months they thoroughly analyzed some 120 companies, gradually whittling it down until their search and acquisition phases came to a close with the successful acquisition of Universidad Tres Culturas, a private university in the central region of Mexico (through the creation of Lottus Education as a holding company in the educational sector)</span></p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\"><span style=\"background-color:transparent;font-size:14px;\">&nbsp;</span></p><h2 style=\"margin-left:0px;\">EXPLOSIVE GROWTH AND AN UNEXPECTED EXIT</h2><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\"><span style=\"background-color:transparent;font-size:14px;\">At the time of acquisition, the university had about 5,000 students and three campuses, but once Angel and his partners dove into operations, they kicked off their ambitious plans for growth. They opened six new campuses in the first three years, doubled the number of degree programs on offer, launched three master degrees, and added a new line of business through a “nights-and-weekends” executive education format. “We started growing and growing and growing,” Angel explained, never missing a beat. “The combination of opening all those new campuses, adding those additional degrees, the masters, and the executive education programs created tremendous growth for our business over the first three years.”</span></p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\"><span style=\"background-color:transparent;font-size:14px;\">This exceptional and rapid growth led to another unexpected surprise: an early liquidity window. While their initial plan had been to grow the company through operations for five to seven years, the team received an unsolicited and very attractive offer after just under three years. And while most of their investor base decided to accept the offer, their new financial sponsors also allowed some of their investors to stay on and reinvest, and Jesus stayed on as CEO (and is still CEO to this day).</span></p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\"><span style=\"background-color:transparent;font-size:14px;\">Their exit proved to be one of the most successful stories in Latin America’s search fund history. “It was a bit of an atypical exit because it was actually a partial exit for us from an equity point of view,” Angel clarified. “That allowed us to complete the full search fund process yet still participate in the continuous growth of the business. Today, the company is about 10 times larger in all of the metrics – from campuses and students, to revenues and EBITDA – than it was when we acquired it six years ago.”</span></p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\"><span style=\"background-color:transparent;font-size:14px;\">&nbsp;</span></p><h2 style=\"margin-left:0px;\">SEARCH FUNDS = A GREAT INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITY</h2><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\"><span style=\"background-color:transparent;font-size:14px;\">In August 2018, after his successful exit, Angel and his search fund partner Guillermo launched ALZA Capital Partners, an institutional $50 million fund for search funds. Since their launch two and half years ago, ALZA Capital Partners has backed over 50 searchers globally and is halfway through their investment period, having already invested in 20 company acquisitions that make up their current portfolio.</span></p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\"><span style=\"background-color:transparent;font-size:14px;\">Given Angel’s history of success in the industry, he’s perfectly poised to explain why search funds are a great investment opportunity. He begins by explaining what he defines as the perfect acquisition: “The perfect acquisition is the right company at the right price,” Angel says. “It can be easy to make an acquisition. The challenge lies in making a really nice acquisition at a very attractive price.”</span></p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\"><span style=\"background-color:transparent;font-size:14px;\">That being said, one of the key advantages of search funds is that they provide a structured path to finding great businesses to buy, explains Angel. Many of the companies targeted by search funds (which tend to have an EBITDA in the range of $1-4 million) exist under the radar of most private equity firms and financial sponsors. And because a searcher is given up to 24 months to find the right company to acquire, the searcher and their teams are able to analyze several dozen businesses to finally arrive at the perfect acquisition. “One of the attractive things about search funds is that you’re looking to buy a solid business with a history of profitability, recurrent revenues and a diversified client base. You’re looking for an opportunity with a very attractive risk return profile. You’re not looking for turnarounds. You’re looking for companies that are doing well, which also turns out to be a very natural reason why current business owners want to exit their business.” A win-win for both, buyers and sellers.</span></p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\"><span style=\"background-color:transparent;font-size:14px;\">Additionally, search funds by their very nature require that the searcher be in alignment with the company and their investors as they all have common equity. “The searcher is usually a top talented entrepreneur who’s poised to become CEO, with a capacity to really grow the company and bring an added level of professionalism to the business in many cases,” says Angel. Professionalism that comes from the searcher’s strong academic and professional background, paired with guidance and advice from a professional board of investors who invest alongside the searcher. In search funds, there’s a knowledge-sharing that is empowering for every stakeholder.</span></p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\"><span style=\"background-color:transparent;font-size:14px;\">“As the ecosystem has been growing, there’s been a significant number of more institutional investors joining the asset class who do this full-time,” adds Angel. “That professionalism is reflected in the structure of the program, the board dynamics, and in the guidance that’s provided to the searchers on a day-to-day basis. Some of these investors have invested in over a hundred companies, so they offer a great critical eye and provide important feedback when searchers are trying to figure out whether a company is a good investment. All of these features combined is what creates an amazing profile for search funds, allowing for great returns with moderate risk on these types of investments.”</span></p>', '2023-12-14 13:40:41', '2023-12-14 13:40:41'),

Discover what makes NCA unique and get to know our founders by diving into the Q&A below:', 'elena-trukhina--christian-malek--qa-with-nca-co-ceos', 1, 0, '<h2 style=\"margin-left:0px;\"><span style=\"background-color:transparent;font-size:26px;\">Q: Elena, Christian, can you tell us about some of the main highlights of 2020 for NCA?</span></h2><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\"><span style=\"background-color:transparent;font-size:14px;\"><strong>Christian:</strong> For NCA, 2019 was about testing and shaping our ETA concept, designing and putting together the processes, and hiring the team. 2020 was essentially our first full year of operations when we had new co-investors join and launched our first search funds.</span></p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\"><span style=\"background-color:transparent;font-size:14px;\"><strong>Elena:</strong> We had around 3,000 applications to our ETA program in 2020. We ran three assessment centers in Europe and kicked off the first assessment center in the USA, which was quite a significant and important step for our program. I would say 2020 was a very important year for us in all aspects.</span></p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\"><span style=\"background-color:transparent;font-size:14px;\">&nbsp;</span></p><h2 style=\"margin-left:0px;\"><span style=\"background-color:transparent;font-size:26px;\">Q: Christian, you invested in numerous search funds before founding NCA; Can you explain why Search Funds are such a great asset class to invest in?</span></h2><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\"><span style=\"background-color:transparent;font-size:14px;\"><strong>Christian:</strong> One of the great things about search funds is that they are all about &nbsp;people. So instead of investing in a company and then trying to pinpoint who will manage it, you start from the very beginning by finding the right person. You have many interactions with that person over the course of the search process, which takes up to two years, so you get to know them very well. Compare that to a traditional private equity fund, where investors provide capital yet have absolutely no say in how the private equity is used. Our searchers also know that this is a once in a lifetime opportunity for them, and that the capital is not committed outright so they have to convince investors that the deal is good. That puts a healthy amount of pressure on them to do their search and gives them great incentive to deliver. I think that’s one very important element of what makes search funds such a great asset class to invest in. Interests are aligned across the board.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\"><span style=\"background-color:transparent;font-size:14px;\">Another important aspect to consider is that our searchers have been thoroughly vetted by NCA and investors. Investors can rely on the fact that we are also co-investing. That means they can trust us to pick the right people, because not every investor has the time to speak with every searcher and regularly monitor them. That’s why what we’re doing is so beneficial for larger investors who really want to have exposure to this asset class; they can rely on a trusted process and have access to an exceptional group of entrepreneurs when it comes to the investments. Our program offers an element of increased efficiency and a solid alignment of interests that simply makes sense for our co-investors.</span><br><span style=\"background-color:transparent;font-size:14px;\">&nbsp;</span></p><h2 style=\"margin-left:0px;\"><span style=\"background-color:transparent;font-size:26px;\">Q: Elena, if you could tell potential investors the top 3 reasons why they should choose to co-invest with NCA, what would they be?</span></h2><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\"><span style=\"background-color:transparent;font-size:14px;\"><strong>Elena:</strong> The first reason to co-invest with NCA that I would highlight is the proprietary deal flow generated through our program. Many investors would like to invest into private equity directly, however generating deal flow is not that easy. Our program is a perfect vehicle for generating proprietary deal flow. NCA’s program is built around a future CEO who personally scouts the market within the area of their expertise for the ideal company they would like to manage as CEO, so you can access very interesting off-market, proprietary deals. Our ETA program is actively onboarding many talented individuals, all with different industry backgrounds and who are searching in different markets, so NCA’s program is a really powerful machine for generating deal flow that offers co-investors an opportunity to build a large and diversified portfolio.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\"><span style=\"background-color:transparent;font-size:14px;\">Secondly, this asset class has amazing historical records of performance. On average search funds generate IRR of 33.7%, which is impressive by all standards. One of the main reasons behind this exceptional performance is the strong alignment of interests. If a searcher finds a great company, at the right valuation, and creates IRR at a level of around 35%, they can get up to 20% of the shares of the acquired company, which is a great upside for the searcher that’s highly linked to performance. That alignment of interests yields very impressive results.</span><br>&nbsp;</p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\"><span style=\"background-color:transparent;font-size:14px;\">Last but not least, we also invest in every transaction ourselves alongside our other co-investors, who are not charged any fees when they co-invest. Our program embodies the true spirit of co-investment and thrives through a powerful alignment of interests.</span></p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\"><span style=\"background-color:transparent;font-size:14px;\">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><h2 style=\"margin-left:0px;\"><span style=\"background-color:transparent;font-size:26px;\">Q: Christian, can you explain 3 ways that NCA’s program differs from a traditional search fund from an investor’s perspective?</span></h2><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\"><span style=\"background-color:transparent;font-size:14px;\"><strong>Christian:</strong> When you choose to co-invest with NCA, the first thing to consider is that our searchers have gone through an extremely structured, disciplined and rigorous selection process, unlike other searchers trying to raise a search fund on their own. Very few people qualify for our program. Secondly, our searchers tend to be entrepreneurs with more professional and managerial know-how, who often have vast experience in very particular industries. That’s reflected in their connections and expertise, which grow exponentially with age and experience. Thirdly, in our program the searchers have to buy a unit for themselves, so they actively participate in the search capital, have the same incentives and objectives, and are personally invested.</span></p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\"><span style=\"background-color:transparent;font-size:14px;\">And lastly, I’d also say that NCA’s program is different from a traditional search fund because our searchers are backed by a team of experts. You could compare it to completing an MBA program at a top business school versus completing an MBA program on your own at home. It’s technically the same thing, but your work and the results are going to be so much better when you are in a program. The NCA team of experts and the support network that we offer not only help our searchers find a company, but also empower them to find one as quickly as possible, while also ensuring value creation upon acquisition. We are building extensive support functions for our searchers, and since we are launching many searchers simultaneously, we are able to share the associated costs across them all and guarantee that all of them have access to better resources. At the end of the day, we are aiming for every single one of our searchers to find a company.</span></p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\"><span style=\"background-color:transparent;font-size:14px;\">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><h2 style=\"margin-left:0px;\"><span style=\"background-color:transparent;font-size:26px;\">Q: 2021 started with launching three NCA Entrepreneurs; can you tell us more about what else we can expect this year?</span></h2><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\"><span style=\"background-color:transparent;font-size:14px;\"><strong>Elena:</strong> 2021 will be about expansion and new markets for us. We will be launching search funds across many markets in Europe and will be expanding our program in the US. That expansion is very focused on attracting top talent to our ETA program and we want to tap into both female and male talent pools equally, in the hopes that our program will additionally encourage female entrepreneurship.</span></p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\"><span style=\"background-color:transparent;font-size:14px;\">We are also currently amassing a larger group of investors that are co-investing together with us. The majority of these investors are Single Family Offices and the co-investment ambiance amongst our program members is truly amazing. We certainly want to maintain that going forward while also welcoming new co-investors to our program, especially in the new markets where we will be launching our next searchers. It is important for us and for all other co-investors to have a local footprint in tandem with the local investors who will be joining our program.</span></p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\"><span style=\"background-color:transparent;font-size:14px;\">Our team will also be growing so we can support more searchers. We are building out several work streams within our organization to ensure all our searchers buy the right company and buy it fast, such as data analytics center, M&amp;A center, legal support, talent acquisition, and talent management teams. We are also investing in educational programs for our searchers. In other words, it is a work in progress, but all our expansion plans will be fully supported by growing our team as we continue to improve our operational practices across all aspects of our business.</span></p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\"><span style=\"background-color:transparent;font-size:14px;\">&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\"><span style=\"background-color:transparent;font-size:14px;\"><i><strong>Want to know more?

It’s a good question. NCA believes that selecting a diverse pool of talented searchers is essential for the program’s success. Equally, it believes how that diversity is achieved is crucial.', 'sara-yates--nca-celebrates-selecting-first-female-searcher', 1, 0, '<h2 style=\"margin-left:0px;text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"background-color:transparent;font-size:26px;\"><strong>THE ETA PROGRAMME ATTRACTS DIVERSE TALENT</strong></span></h2><p style=\"margin-left:0px;text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"background-color:transparent;font-size:14px;\">The ETA programme supports exceptional individuals to search, acquire and then run successful SMEs as CEOs. Since the programme’s inception in Q4 2020, NCA has launched 9 searchers, the 8th of whom (Rania) is female. Four more will be announced shortly, with another women amongst their ranks.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"background-color:transparent;font-size:14px;\">The ETA programme is still in its infancy, yet the diversity it has already generated is already significantly better than the industry average. At the start of 2021 only 6% of companies in the S&amp;P 500 had a female CEO. That is just 30 companies led by women. Within Private Equity the figures are even worse. According to a 2020 study by Investec, women only account for 18% of the entire workforce and none of those surveyed wanted to start their own PE firm (down from a paltry 2.3% in 2019).</span></p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;text-align:justify;\">&nbsp;</p><figure class=\"image image-style-side image_resized\" style=\"width:22.22%;\"><img style=\"aspect-ratio:875/875;\" src=\"https://explorelogicsit.net/nca/portal/media/Sara-Yates-min_1702561458.png\" width=\"875\" height=\"875\"></figure><h2 style=\"margin-left:0px;text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"background-color:transparent;font-size:26px;\"><strong>THE PROGRAMME’S EXISTENCE UNSHACKLES CANDIDATES FROM NEEDING A TRADITIONALLY MALE SKILLSET</strong></span></h2><p style=\"margin-left:0px;text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"background-color:transparent;font-size:14px;\">Christian Malek, founder and CEO of NCA, believes the programme’s structure is key to generating diversity in its searchers. “Traditional Private Equity investing is very focused on the acquisition and generating short term gains. This aggressive style of investing tends to appeal more to a subset of men” he commented.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"background-color:transparent;font-size:14px;\">“The ETA programme is purposefully different. There is a whole team supporting the searcher to acquire a company. This includes an M&amp;A team to help structure the deal, a data centre to aid their search and various formal training opportunities. Then, there is a captable with around 15 investors, none of whom has a majority share, to lead, collaborate with and learn from as they grow the acquired company” he added. This breadth of support takes the focus off the traditional transactional skillset and enables a wider pool of individuals to succeed.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;text-align:justify;\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;text-align:justify;\">&nbsp;</p><h2 style=\"margin-left:0px;text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"background-color:transparent;font-size:26px;\"><strong>THE JOURNEY TO DIVERSITY MATTERS</strong></span></h2><p style=\"margin-left:0px;text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"background-color:transparent;font-size:14px;\">“It is not in anyone’s interest to target diversity to the detriment of the quality of the candidates,” said Christian. Rather NCA is building a culture that puts talent first. Rania’s route to being selected was no different to her male predecessors. Like them, she had to make her CV shine bright enough to be short listed from a pool of over 800 other candidates, pass a first round interview, pass a second round interview, complete a gruelling financial case study and finally convince a three person panel that she was the right person for the job.&nbsp;By putting talent first, NCA believes it allows the diversity and individualism of its searchers to shine through as positive attributes and enhance its programme.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;text-align:justify;\">&nbsp;</p><h2 style=\"margin-left:0px;text-align:justify;\"><strong>DIVERSITY MAKES GREAT BUSINESS SENSE AND IS ESSENTIAL FOR ETA</strong></h2><p style=\"margin-left:0px;text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"background-color:transparent;font-size:14px;\">Diversity is good for business. According to research by McKinsey &amp; Company, gender diverse companies are 15% more likely to outperform their peers and ethnically-diverse companies are 35% more likely to do the same.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"background-color:transparent;font-size:14px;\">At NCA, the business case for a diverse pool of searcher is even stronger. Each searcher needs to convince an SME owner that they are capable of managing their company. But SMEs are by their very nature personal, idiosyncratic and diverse. By selecting a diverse group of talented people who are backed by the support, structure and knowhow of the ETA programme, NCA believes searchers will be better placed to find, acquire and grow a company.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;text-align:justify;\">&nbsp;</p><h2 style=\"margin-left:0px;text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"background-color:transparent;font-size:26px;\"><strong>MAKES SENSE FOR INVESTORS TOO</strong></span></h2><p style=\"margin-left:0px;text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"background-color:transparent;font-size:14px;\">Investing in a searcher to become a future CEO started in the mid 1980s. Since then, it has delivered phenomenal returns, with Stanford’s latest study finding an average pre-tax IRR of over 30% and a return on invested capital of 5.5x. By encapsulating the search process into the ETA programme, NCA believes it can further improve the asset class’s metrics – great news for investors.&nbsp;As, if not more important, the programme offers investors who value diversity and impact investing, the opportunity to build a tailored portfolio of direct investments in SMEs across Europe and US. And there are no fees.

However, Christian is keenly aware that there is still more to do. “We need to understand the reasons behind having less women and people from ethnic backgrounds applying to the program. There may be structural issues that are difficult to change quickly but we are committed to supporting a broader pool of talent applying to the programme. That is why we are looking closely at how we communicate, considering how we reach talent that hasn’t taken the traditional business school route, as well working hand in hand with those schools to reach all the talent there.”</span></p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;text-align:justify;\">&nbsp;</p><h2 style=\"margin-left:0px;text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"background-color:transparent;font-size:26px;\"><strong>JUST A TALENT STAMP NEEDED</strong></span></h2><p style=\"margin-left:0px;text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"background-color:transparent;font-size:14px;\">To answer Rania’s question, women don’t need a gender stamp to be a searcher on the ETA programme.

The Rapaport Group, which was started by his father in 1976 in New York, had organically and sporadically grown until it had over 225 employees in 12 different offices, spanning six countries and four business units. As the company evolved, Mordy recognized that shifting to a more structured environment would be key to the company’s success. Mordy was responsible for restructuring the company’s publishing business unit and then went on to become COO, overseeing all of the company’s centralized management functions. “The accumulation of all that experience gave me great insights into the world of operations and how a focus on bottom-up operations, can really lead to improving the company’s performance and people’s opportunities within the company. That experience guided me to truly understand the importance of operational excellence.”</span></p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\"><span style=\"background-color:transparent;font-size:14px;\">After 12 years with the family business, Mordy decided to forge a new path and founded A-6684 Capital, where he is currently CEO. Structured as a private equity fund, Mordy explained that A-6684 Capital looks to acquire companies that are profitable in nature, with a focus on businesses that are predominantly people and process-oriented. The company takes a long-term approach to managing businesses by consistently striving for maximum efficiency and operational excellence. “When it comes to operations, we’re detail-oriented because the details are really how one goes about improving a business and building a foundation upon which scale can be achieved. For example, many businesses we review typically have human resource-related costs amounting to 75 to 80%, so it’s important to make sure companies are running very efficiently by hiring the right people and investing in their development and growth.”</span></p><figure class=\"image image-style-side image_resized\" style=\"width:27.98%;\"><img style=\"aspect-ratio:1009/1206;\" src=\"https://explorelogicsit.net/nca/portal/media/62-_DSC5163-photographergeneva.com-Kopie_1702561593.jpg\" width=\"1009\" height=\"1206\"></figure><h2 style=\"margin-left:0px;\"><span style=\"background-color:transparent;font-size:26px;\"><strong>ADDING VALUE THROUGH SEARCH FUNDS AND THE NCA CONNECTION</strong></span></h2><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\"><span style=\"background-color:transparent;font-size:14px;\">Mordy met NCA Co-Founder and Co-CEO Christian Malek while at IMD Business School in Switzerland in 2017 and became involved with NCA from an early stage in an advisory role. Mordy finds Search Funds interesting and attractive because “they seem to work; the returns substantiate that. My firm also looks at the same types of businesses as a Search Fund: companies that are traditional, profitable, and have room for us to come in and add value through optimization.”</span></p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\"><span style=\"background-color:transparent;font-size:14px;\">&nbsp;As an NCA Advisory Board member, Mordy plays a crucial role in selecting candidates for the NCA Entrepreneurship Through Acquisition program. He explains that one of the unique features of the NCA program is that NCA entrepreneurs tend to be slightly more mature and have demonstrated experience in their field. “When we interview people for NCA’s program, we’re looking for people that have both hunger <i>and</i> experience, as opposed to just one or the other,” he explains, “which I think increases the odds of success.”</span></p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\"><span style=\"background-color:transparent;font-size:14px;\">&nbsp;By the time Mordy sits down with potential NCA candidates, he knows they’ve been whittled down from a large pool of talent and have already been thoroughly vetted by the NCA team. So what does Mordy look for when it’s his turn to evaluate potential NCA Entrepreneurs? “I tend to look more attentively at soft skills, like leadership capabilities, and I try to understand whether this candidate is going to stick around when things get tough,” he says. “Embarking on a Search Fund with someone can be a ten-year-long journey, so if I see someone whose CV shows they’ve jumped companies every three or four years, I want to understand why. I need to know they’ll be committed to the very end.”</span></p><h2 style=\"margin-left:0px;\"><span style=\"background-color:transparent;font-size:26px;\"><strong>KEY OPERATIONAL SKILLS IN GOOD LEADERS</strong></span></h2><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\"><span style=\"background-color:transparent;font-size:14px;\">Mordy’s many years of top-level operational experience have given him deep insights into the world of operations and enabled him to identify key traits that stand out in successful operators, like humility. “I think humility is a very important skill because it lends itself to leading by example,” he says. “I’m looking for humble people. I’m also detail-oriented, so I look for that in the people who would be working with us.”</span></p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\"><span style=\"background-color:transparent;font-size:14px;\">&nbsp;When asked what factors set <i>good</i> operators apart from <i>great</i> operators, Mordy explained that “a really amazing operator is somebody who’s able to take their operational experience – which I place a core emphasis on – and marry that to value orientation with regards to the finance component. A great all-around operator is someone who is not only a focused and passionate manager, they are also able to sit down and skillfully allocate capital or structure deals that would blow your mind.”</span></p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\"><span style=\"background-color:transparent;font-size:14px;\">&nbsp;Mordy’s leadership experience continues to play an important part in shaping NCA’s program, which began its full operational rollout in 2020. “Most Search Funds up until now have been predominantly supported by a very small group of investors,” explains Mordy, “so one of the things that’s interesting about NCA is that they’re opening Search Funds to more searchers and investors. In addition, their program is designed to facilitate the process of actually getting a Search Fund up and running. NCA’s support team enables their Searchers to move into the Search Fund process faster and more efficiently.” And with Mordy’s expertise on the Advisory Board, one can be assured that striving for operational excellence will always be a key component of any NCA Searcher’s journey. “There’s just no substitute for experience,” Mordy emphasizes, “especially when it comes to operations.”</span></p><figure class=\"image image-style-side image_resized\" style=\"width:29.72%;\"><img style=\"aspect-ratio:300/212;\" src=\"https://explorelogicsit.net/nca/portal/media/NCA-Searcher-Recruitment-Cycle-2021-300x212_1702561616.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"212\"></figure><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\"><span style=\"background-color:transparent;font-size:14px;\"><i>NCA Entrepreneurs are being assessed and selected for the company’s unique ETA program on a rolling basis.

His success is marked by some notable firsts: Sébastien is the first Searcher to officially complete NCA’s Entrepreneurship Through Acquisition program; he’s the first to complete the search process in a blazing record pace of only 7 months, and he’s the first to end with the acquisition of not just one company, but <i>three</i>. Read below to learn more about Sébastien’s journey, as he takes us back through the career highlights that led up to this current moment and explains some of the details of his search process in partnership with NCA.</p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;text-align:justify;\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;text-align:justify;\">&nbsp;</p><h2 style=\"margin-left:0px;text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"background-color:transparent;font-size:26px;\"><strong>CAREER PHASE ONE: THE EARLY DAYS</strong></span></h2><p style=\"margin-left:0px;text-align:justify;\">Sébastien Perroud’s career has taken him through a wide range of roles and high-tech SMEs in Switzerland, but it all really started when he was working as an engineer at the Swiss Centre for Electronics and Microtechnology (CSEM). He had developed small robots for his thesis in collaboration with CSEM while pursuing his diploma, and that technology ended up winning the 2007 Swiss Technology Award.</p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"background-color:transparent;font-size:14px;\">“Around that time I had started to question whether being an engineer was really the best choice for me,” explained Sébastien. “I already had the heart of a manager, in terms of the communication and leadership skills. I could understand what the customer wanted, translate that to the engineer who developed it, and then translate it back from the engineer to the customer again.”</span></p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"background-color:transparent;font-size:14px;\">Sébastien’s award-winning technology was acquired by a company in Switzerland, which incorporated Asyril SA to industrialize and market it, and they offered him a role on the team that same year. He seized the opportunity to shift positions and quickly transitioned into leading marketing and sales. In parallel, he undertook an Executive MBA in Innovation Management at the Bern University of Applied Sciences to broaden his management and financial skillset.</span></p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"background-color:transparent;font-size:14px;\">By 2012, he was ready for a change and joined NUM AG as Director of the Swiss branch office, which led to him managing various markets over the next three years across Europe, India, China, and the USA.</span></p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;text-align:justify;\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;text-align:justify;\">&nbsp;</p><h2 style=\"margin-left:0px;text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"background-color:transparent;font-size:26px;\"><strong>CAREER PHASE TWO: NEW INDUSTRIES, NEW INSIGHTS</strong></span></h2><p style=\"margin-left:0px;text-align:justify;\">In 2015, Sébastien began to branch out into new industries. He spent one year working in the watchmaking industry and then moved into the paper industry in 2016 as Division Director.</p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;text-align:justify;\">The time he spent in that role left a lasting impression, as he joined the company just as a management buyout was coming to a close, but when Sébastien’s old boss from NUM AG approached him about coming back in 2018, he realized he was ready to return to his roots.</p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;text-align:justify;\">“I learned a lot while working in the paper industry,” Sébastien explained, “but there were two main takeaways that really stayed with me: One was having first-hand experience when implementing a business plan after a management buyout, and especially learning what kinds of mistakes to avoid during that process.” He continued: “The other was realizing that I actually wanted to be back in my old industry. I was still passionate about machinery and automation, and while working in the paper industry had been a really good experience for me, it just didn’t take full advantage of my engineering background.”</p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;text-align:justify;\">&nbsp;</p><h2 style=\"margin-left:0px;text-align:justify;\"><strong>CAREER PHASE THREE: RETURN TO MEM ROOTS</strong></h2><p style=\"margin-left:0px;text-align:justify;\">In 2018 Sébastien was offered a Managing Director role at NUM AG where he spearheaded sales, led ten worldwide subsidiaries, and opened new subsidiaries in India. “That was a great experience,” reflected Sébastien, “both on the business side and the human side. Culturally, India is very different from Europe, so it was interesting and a little crazy to open something over there and go through the whole incorporation process, the acquisition, hiring a managing director and staff, and everything that goes along with that.”</p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;text-align:justify;\">In 2019, Sébastien decided to pursue international management training through Zürich Kalaidos University to complement his growing professional responsibilities. He found himself in Silicon Valley as part of a course on entrepreneurship. The course covered the classic startup route to becoming an entrepreneur – something that had never appealed to Sébastien – but there was another part of the course about Search Funds. Suddenly, Sébastien knew exactly what he needed to do.</p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;text-align:justify;\">&nbsp;</p><h2 style=\"margin-left:0px;text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"background-color:transparent;font-size:26px;\"><strong>CAREER PHASE FOUR: ENTER THE SEARCH FUND</strong></span></h2><figure class=\"image image-style-side image_resized\" style=\"width:29.08%;\"><img style=\"aspect-ratio:1709/2560;\" src=\"https://explorelogicsit.net/nca/portal/media/Sebastien-WEB-1-scaled_1702561930.jpg\" width=\"1709\" height=\"2560\"></figure><p style=\"margin-left:0px;text-align:justify;\">Learning about Search Funds was a revelation for Sébastien. “My whole career up until that point had been about positioning myself for the possibility of a management buyout, but that path is very time-consuming. In Switzerland, you need to be about 40 years old but not quite 50, because then you’re too old. So you have roughly a five-year window to make your move, and if you are not in the right place at the right time during that window, you’re basically out. It’s really dependent on luck. And once I learned about Search Funds, I decided to not bet on luck, but to take responsibility.”</p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;text-align:justify;\">A quick search of Swiss Search Funds led Sébastien straight to Novastone Capital Advisors, where the next stage of his career journey rapidly took shape. “I had my first interview within two weeks after contacting NCA, just before lockdown began,” explained Sébastien. “The one positive side of the lockdown was that because the economy was practically on hold, I suddenly had extra time, so I made the most of that time by working on my Business Case.”</p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;text-align:justify;\">Sébastien finished his Business Case in July, started fundraising with Co-Investors in September, and closed fundraising just before Christmas 2020. Then he resigned and readied himself to start his search, which officially kicked off in March 2021. By mid-October – a record pace in the Search Fund world – his search was done, and he had three companies lined up for acquisition: One in Switzerland, one in Portugal, and one in the USA. Why three companies? “Well, I didn’t actually plan to buy three companies when I started the search,” Sébastien said smiling. “What I was really hoping for was to find a company with revenues in the range of 20+ million and an international footprint.”</p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;text-align:justify;\">Sébastien had contacted roughly a hundred companies in Switzerland and Germany by sending out an introductory email that explained his project, who he was, and what he was trying to do. His transparent approach paid off: Sébastien had an impressive 90% response rate. He explained his search process: “Quite often, the response was something like, ‘I’m not willing to sell the company but you’re in the industry, so let’s have a coffee together.’ So we would have a meeting but just for networking and talking. That was great. And when business owners were interested, they would actually call me, not email me. And it was like an interview for the CEO role of the company.” If the interview stage went well, an in-person meeting at the company followed.</p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;text-align:justify;\">“It was very important to me to quickly have a first contact with the company,” Sébastien added. “You have to be comfortable from the beginning. The thought of spending years working for a company where I was not comfortable – whether that was with the people, the project, the location, the building, or whatever –<span style=\"background-color:transparent;font-size:14px;\">&nbsp; </span>was an absolute no-go for me. So even during the pandemic, I insisted on having an in-person meeting.”</p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;text-align:justify;\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;text-align:justify;\">&nbsp;</p><h2 style=\"margin-left:0px;text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"background-color:transparent;font-size:26px;\"><strong>CAREER STAGE FIVE: CLOSING THE DEAL</strong></span></h2><p style=\"margin-left:0px;text-align:justify;\">It is well known that Entrepreneurship Through Acquisition is not for the faint of heart, which is where NCA steps in, offering a wide range of services to support Searchers on their journey. For Sébastien, NCA’s sophisticated Co-Investor network of HNWIs and family offices was key. “NCA has a huge network of very interesting Co-Investors who are real entrepreneurs. I’m really happy about my Co-Investors,” he added, “because I know all of them understand the challenges of being the CEO of a company. They themselves have gone through the process of successfully running companies, so I know we see eye to eye.”</p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;text-align:justify;\">The second key strength NCA was able to offer Sébastien during his search was support from the M&amp;A team. “The M&amp;A team helped me gather and model preliminary information and financial information on the businesses within a short time frame,” Sébastien explained. “After just a few days they would come back to me and say, ‘the company is looking good,’ or ‘the company is not looking good,’ or they’d offer input or advice, for example, that I need to ask for more information about this, or be careful about that, and so on.”</p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;text-align:justify;\">While NCA also has a robust data team and offers marketing support, Sébastien was already deeply entrenched in his industry and relied primarily on his personal approach and network to connect with potential companies. “I always presented myself as an entrepreneur willing to buy a company with the support of NCA and my Co-Investors. But for searchers who are just starting out in a new industry, the data team and marketing support are certainly very, very helpful,” he added.</p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;text-align:justify;\">Sébastien knew his industry well, so right from the start he had strong resonance from his network when he announced he was looking to buy a company. Sébastien’s first lead in Switzerland was a good fit, with a great product, but there wasn’t a very large international footprint. “I’m in an industry where an international footprint is a must,” said Sébastien, “it’s a need because it’s an export business.” So Sébastien kept reviewing other potential companies as he continued his search, while another idea began to form in his mind.</p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;text-align:justify;\">Most of the companies Sébastien was considering only had one location, but he could see a lot of technical, commercial, and operational synergies. As he explored deeper, Sébastien proposed the idea of joining forces as a group. “I ended up with three companies that had a lot of synergies, so it made sense to explore the potential of joining forces.” He continued: “On top of that since they would not just be absorbed, each of the three managing directors and their teams would have the chance to shape the future of the group.”</p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;text-align:justify;\">Of course, no deal comes easy, and one of the biggest challenges of doing a three-for-one deal was ensuring everyone was on board with the timing. “Before even beginning due diligence I made sure all the business owners were aligned on the time frame,” explained Sébastien. “I told them I wanted to create the group and proposed that in the early stages of discussion with every business owner. I made sure everyone was aligned on the deadlines from the beginning.” That meant being upfront not only with the business owners, but also with their teams, the various advisors, lawyers, and Sébastien’s Co-Investors, who also needed to commit and be ready to close on the agreed-upon date.</p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;text-align:justify;\">“Usually with Search Funds, you only do one round of fundraising from your Co-Investors, so you propose one deal,” explained Sébastien. “I knew this limitation, but after discussing with NCA, I realized that it could be one deal with three companies <i>if</i> we bought all three companies at once. So that really pushed me to close all three companies within a 10-day time frame. It was all about alignment and clear communication about the objectives.”</p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;text-align:justify;\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;text-align:justify;\">&nbsp;</p><h2 style=\"margin-left:0px;text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"background-color:transparent;font-size:26px;\"><strong>ETA SUCCESS &amp; FINAL WORDS</strong></span></h2><p style=\"margin-left:0px;text-align:justify;\">At the end of the day, Sébastien’s approach, which could be considered a “buy and build strategy,” paid off. “I don’t know if something like this has already been done in Search Funds,” he said, “but I’m really happy to be able to do this in a way where we were all together from the beginning. What’s great with this kind of buy and build strategy is that – if it’s well-executed, with carefully chosen companies – you can really take full advantage of senior teams to build a strong group. And when I say take full advantage, I mean we have plenty of synergies that can be used from day one, like possibilities to export the Swiss product in the US, export the US skills in Portugal, and so on.”</p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;text-align:justify;\">Transparency with everyone involved was also a key factor in Sébastien’s success. “I always bet on transparency,” he explained. “Transparency and being honest- that’s always the best way to do things. It helps avoid problems down the line and usually when people notice that you do what you say and say what you do, that gives you credibility and allows for people to trust you. That’s really how you earn people’s respect.”</p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;text-align:justify;\">When asked if he had any final words, Sébastien said it feels great to have successfully completed his search. With his deal featuring three times the usual number of moving parts, he certainly had his hands full as the deadline approached. “I went through a very, very demanding and exciting closing phase, which took much more energy than I had thought,” said Sébastien. “We were still negotiating the Sales and Purchase Agreements, but I also already had a foot in the door for my future role. And then I was also working with the Co-Investors at the same time because you have to explain the deal.”</p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;text-align:justify;\">A word of advice from Sébastien for future Searchers: “When you start the capital call, it’s the most exciting phase and you need to be convinced and willing to close it. It’s lots of 16-hour days,” Sébastien laughed, “and is full of ups and downs every day until the final signatures are done. But that’s what it means to become an Entrepreneur Through Acquisition, and it is more than worth it to go through that process.” He concluded: “I’m very, very happy, and I’m so proud to be where I am today and to have Co-Investors trusting me as we go along this path of shaping this incredible group. Now I’m looking forward to creating value as I start my job as the group CEO. It was and is just an amazing time.”</p>', '2023-12-14 13:52:26', '2023-12-14 13:52:26'),

His career has been broad, spanning a diverse range of industries including law, strategy development and implementation, venture/private equity investments, and even entrepreneurship: Before joining NCA, Jan had already co-founded two other companies (renewable energy &amp; biotech).</span></p><blockquote><p style=\"margin-left:0px;text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"background-color:transparent;font-size:14px;\">“I’ve been privileged in the sense that I’ve been allowed to do many different things before I eventually became an entrepreneur myself,” said Jan.</span></p></blockquote><p style=\"margin-left:0px;text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"background-color:transparent;font-size:14px;\">By 2019, Jan had been looking to make his next career move, and that’s when he discovered NCA. Although he had considered co-founding another company, he was also itching for a new challenge.</span></p><blockquote><p style=\"margin-left:0px;text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"background-color:transparent;font-size:14px;\">“At a certain point you start to wonder how many more times you can build something from scratch,” he explained when asked about the appeal of NCA’s ETA program. “The truth is that the first few years as a co-founder involve a lot of risks and most companies don’t even make it past the five-year mark. Something that intrigued me about NCA’s ETA&nbsp;program is the idea of being able to kind of jump ahead of that and go directly to a position of being in charge of a company that already has a certain size and proof of concept in place.”</span></p></blockquote><p style=\"margin-left:0px;text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"background-color:transparent;font-size:14px;\">NCA’s ETA program’s sequence of events and funding process also appealed to Jan.</span></p><blockquote><p style=\"margin-left:0px;text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"background-color:transparent;font-size:14px;\">“As an entrepreneur, you often have an idea or concept that you like, and then you have to spend a lot of time trying to convince investors that they should fund you,” he said. “What motivated me with this program is that it works the other way around: you kind of get the capital first, and then you look for a good idea having expressed itself in the form of a successful company that has potential to grow.</span></p></blockquote><p style=\"margin-left:0px;text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"background-color:transparent;font-size:26px;\"><strong><u>JAN’S SEARCH IN A NUTSHELL: PEOPLE TO PEOPLE, MENTAL STAMINA &amp; THE CHALLENGES OF COVID</u></strong></span></p><blockquote><p style=\"margin-left:0px;text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"background-color:transparent;font-size:14px;\">“I can relate to business owners because I’ve been through the hard work of starting something from scratch and going through with it,” Jan explained. “I was actually surprised at the ease of starting conversations with owners. I did a lot of searching in the German-speaking world where there’s quite a bit of skepticism regarding private equity and financial investors. I found that even when owners weren’t looking to sell, they were intrigued that a person was contacting them instead of a competitor or some financial company. And getting to speak to so many different business owners was enriching,” Jan continued. “It added a more human touch to the whole search.”</span></p></blockquote><blockquote><p style=\"margin-left:0px;text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"background-color:transparent;font-size:14px;\">“That human touch proved to be key because, as any entrepreneur knows, the journey is long, difficult, and often lonely. If that were not enough, Jan had the extra challenge of undertaking his endeavor in the heart of a pandemic. “Because of COVID, business owners didn’t want to meet in person,” he explained. “We did everything over video calls or other virtual ways. That meant there could be multiple days where I didn’t even leave the house, and that was mentally challenging at times.”</span></p></blockquote><blockquote><p style=\"margin-left:0px;text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"background-color:transparent;font-size:14px;\">“The search process in general has a lot of ups and downs,” Jan added. “One day you think you’ve found a super company, but after you look into it maybe it seems risky, or maybe the owner doesn’t want to talk. So you do a lot of starting over from scratch, and I think having the mental stamina that I had from entrepreneurship helped me in that journey.”</span></p></blockquote><p style=\"margin-left:0px;text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"background-color:transparent;font-size:14px;\"><strong>Despite the challenges Jan’s search ended after only 13-months in part because of his highly targeted approach meaning he contacted fewer than 400 companies and spent the majority of that time finalizing the agreement and closing the deal with a health tech company in Spain.</strong></span></p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"background-color:transparent;font-size:14px;\"><strong><u>3 KEY ELEMENTS OF NCA SUPPORT</u></strong></span></p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"background-color:transparent;color:rgb(229,114,0);font-size:14px;\"><strong>1</strong></span><span style=\"background-color:transparent;font-size:14px;\">&nbsp;<strong>Fundraising and Networking</strong></span></p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"background-color:transparent;color:rgb(229,114,0);font-size:14px;\"><strong>2&nbsp;</strong></span><span style=\"background-color:transparent;font-size:14px;\"><span lang=\"EN\" dir=\"ltr\"><strong>M&amp;A Team</strong></span></span></p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"background-color:transparent;color:rgb(229,114,0);font-size:14px;\"><strong>3 </strong></span><span style=\"background-color:transparent;font-size:14px;\"><span lang=\"EN\" dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Other Searchers</strong></span></span></p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"background-color:transparent;font-size:14px;\">When asked how NCA supported him in his journey, Jan highlighted three areas that were specific to his search. The first was support with fundraising and networking.</span></p><blockquote><p style=\"margin-left:0px;text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"background-color:transparent;font-size:14px;\">“My professional ecosystem did not have a lot of overlap with the type of investors who fund this kind of venture,” said Jan. “If I had done this on my own that would have been a very high mountain for me to climb. And even though we were in the middle of the first wave of COVID, NCA was able to put me in front of investors who already knew about the ETA concept. That meant I didn’t have to sell the concept, I could focus on selling myself. So I really believe being selected for the program gave me a leg up in that way and ensured the fundraising phase went smoothly.”</span></p></blockquote><p style=\"margin-left:0px;text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"background-color:transparent;font-size:14px;\">The second area of invaluable support for Jan came from the NCA M&amp;A Team. In addition to saving time when it came to building the financial model, the team helped refine the structure of the deal and offered a different vantage point and insights.</span></p><blockquote><p style=\"margin-left:0px;text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"background-color:transparent;font-size:14px;\">“Sometimes when you are in the thick of it, you can’t tell the forest from the trees,” said Jan, “so it’s always good to have an aspiring partner who’s a little on the outside and who can question your beliefs with a different perspective.”</span></p></blockquote><p style=\"margin-left:0px;text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"background-color:transparent;font-size:14px;\">The third way the NCA program supported Jan in his search actually came in the form of the other searchers. Jan explained:</span></p><blockquote><p style=\"margin-left:0px;text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"background-color:transparent;font-size:14px;\">“When I was up against some of those mental challenges I mentioned, it was helpful to be able to talk about it with other people who were doing the exact same thing as me. The other Searchers can offer a very different discussion from someone like my wife, my friends, or even the NCA team. Being able to share our progress and talk about our roadblocks was particularly useful for me.”</span></p></blockquote><p style=\"margin-left:0px;text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"background-color:transparent;font-size:14px;\">When asked how it feels to have successfully completed the program, Jan admits that at the end of the day, he didn’t actually join NCA’s ETA program for the search itself; he joined it for what comes after the search.</span></p><blockquote><p style=\"margin-left:0px;text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"background-color:transparent;font-size:14px;\">“Now there’s a certain feeling of satisfaction and a sense of relief,” said Jan, “because even though I’ve felt confident about the deal for the past few months, you just never know until everything is signed and the ink is on the paper. That said, the strongest feeling is one of excitement. The search itself was more like a means to an end to get me to where I really want to be, and now I get to look forward to my favorite part.”</span></p></blockquote><p style=\"margin-left:0px;text-align:justify;\">&nbsp;</p><h2 style=\"margin-left:0px;text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"background-color:transparent;font-size:26px;\"><strong><u>ADVICE FOR ANYONE CONSIDERING THE ETA JOURNEY</u></strong></span></h2><h4 style=\"margin-left:0px;text-align:justify;\">&nbsp;</h4><p style=\"margin-left:0px;text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"background-color:transparent;font-size:14px;\">While everyone’s situation will be different, Jan did have a few suggestions for others who are considering Entrepreneurship Through Acquisition.</span></p><blockquote><p style=\"margin-left:0px;text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"background-color:transparent;font-size:14px;\">“Make sure your motivation is driven by what’s really right for you,” he said, “because it requires a lot of grit and there’s always a risk that it won’t work out.” Jan highlighted the fact that you can’t know where you’ll end up — a simple and often uncomfortable fact of the search journey — and there’s always a chance you might have to relocate. “Of course, that’s part of the excitement,” Jan added, “but on the flip side, if you have a family, it’s not only about you.”</span></p></blockquote><p style=\"margin-left:0px;text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"background-color:transparent;font-size:14px;\">In addition to clear motivational factors, Jan also said it’s important to have a strong support group of good people.</span></p><blockquote><p style=\"margin-left:0px;text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"background-color:transparent;font-size:14px;\">“My advice would be to have people around you who you can trust and really discuss things with,” he said. “It’s impossible for anyone to have all the knowledge and skills and qualifications to do the entire journey on their own. Inevitably there will be things that you don’t know, but you need to have enough self-confidence to know that you can either learn what you don’t know, or you can find people around you who can advise on what you don’t know.”</span></p></blockquote><p style=\"margin-left:0px;text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"background-color:transparent;font-size:14px;\">Despite everything, Jan is ever humble; when prodded about his acquisition he credits luck as the driving factor of his success. As we wrapped up our discussion, he added:</span></p><blockquote><p style=\"margin-left:0px;text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"background-color:transparent;font-size:14px;\">“At the end of the day, you’ll always wonder, ‘is it going to work?’ The truth is, you can prepare all you want but you really just can’t know until you go for it and find out.”</span></p></blockquote><p style=\"margin-left:0px;text-align:center;\"><span style=\"background-color:transparent;color:rgb(229,114,0);font-size:14px;\">***</span></p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;text-align:justify;\"><strong>Jan Nikolaisen’s deal closed in November 2021 making him the second searcher to complete NCA’s Entrepreneurship Through Acquisition program since the program’s launch in 2020.

We sat down with George to learn about his search journey and find out what drove him to pursue Entrepreneurship Through Acquisition in partnership with NCA.</i></span></p></blockquote><h2 style=\"margin-left:0px;text-align:justify;\"><strong>TRACING A MULTINATIONAL CAREER</strong></h2><p style=\"margin-left:0px;text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"background-color:transparent;font-size:14px;\">One could say that George Berczely was born multinational. A British/Austrian citizen, he grew up in Argentina with a British father and an Austrian mother. He studied in Europe, working there before moving to Singapore, Hong Kong, Vietnam, Mexico, and eventually back to Europe. His language skills would put most people to shame: he’s fluent in German, Spanish and English, speaks some French and Portuguese, and even speaks basic Mandarin and Vietnamese.</span></p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"background-color:transparent;font-size:14px;\">So it should come as no surprise that George’s career path is just as multinational as his life experience. After completing his studies in Germany and France, he took a job with McKinsey &amp; Company in Munich, consulting in Transportation &amp; Logistics and Implementation.</span></p><blockquote><p style=\"margin-left:0px;text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"background-color:transparent;font-size:14px;\">“At McKinsey, I learned a lot about how to bring different companies together,” George explained, as one of his key projects had been managing the Program Office of the Post-Merger Integration for Deutsche Post, Danzas and DHL.</span></p></blockquote><p style=\"margin-left:0px;text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"background-color:transparent;font-size:14px;\">Consulting for that client made George realize he wanted more out of his job. “At some point, I started to feel like giving advice just wasn’t enough for me. I wanted to see how things were actually done. I wanted to be there for the implementation of the concept and the ideas. I felt the urge to get my hands dirty and start doing real work myself.”</span></p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"background-color:transparent;font-size:14px;\">That urge motivated George to leave McKinsey for Deutsche Post DHL, where he would stay on for 16 years. George worked across a variety of key roles, mostly in Asia, including being part of the team that started and executed a major division transformation. “Under the leadership of a very visionary CEO, we turned that unit around,” said George. “It went from losing over 1 billion euros a year to consistently making more than 2 billion a year. It was all achieved by motivating people, improving processes, clarifying what we do and what we don’t do, and standardizing. That had a massive impact on people’s lives, job satisfaction, and job security, which impressed me very much. I think that was a great school for me because I learned not just what it means to transform a company, but also how to manage teams and organizations.”</span></p><blockquote><p style=\"margin-left:0px;text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"background-color:transparent;font-size:14px;\">In 2014, George became General Director of DHL Express Vietnam. “That was interesting because it was part of the bigger company, so I was able to manage a decent sized business, but it was my own P&amp;L. I had a lot of entrepreneurial freedom and trust from the organization. I spent four wonderful years polishing that little gem, growing 15% per year, and transforming the unit into a proper multinational. That was a very, very exciting job.”</span></p></blockquote><p style=\"margin-left:0px;text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"background-color:transparent;font-size:14px;\">Around 2020, after feeling like he had exhausted his growth opportunities at DHL, George decided to return to McKinsey, this time within a unit that specifically focused on company transformations. “That had been what excited me most during my time at DHL,” George said, “so I wanted to become even better at it, more professional, better organized, and I wanted to learn to work with new tools, which I did.” But still, George missed being in the field and working with a team. “Consulting just wasn’t ‘hands on’ enough for me,” he explained, “and that’s been a common thread throughout my career; it’s always been about moving closer and closer to the action on the ground.”</span></p><figure class=\"image image-style-side image_resized\" style=\"width:25.39%;\"><img style=\"aspect-ratio:639/1024;\" src=\"https://explorelogicsit.net/nca/portal/media/George-Berczely-1-639x1024_1702562266.jpg\" width=\"639\" height=\"1024\"></figure><h2 style=\"margin-left:0px;text-align:justify;\"><strong>ETA THE LOGICAL NEXT STEP</strong></h2><blockquote><p style=\"margin-left:0px;text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"background-color:transparent;font-size:14px;\">George decided to shift back towards an industry job, but this time at a smaller scale. He explained: “Something I had learned about myself was that while I like to fix things, I like these things to be small enough for me to be able to reach the front line and really understand what is going on. I like to be free of big corporate structures so I can really focus on what I think is important – like the team, the service, the customer – without too much interference.”</span></p></blockquote><p style=\"margin-left:0px;text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"background-color:transparent;font-size:14px;\">After searching for transformation roles within SMEs proved too niche, George realized he’d have to take a bigger leap. “Buying a company was a fairly logical conclusion,” he said. “And, once you’re there, looking at search funds just makes sense. The model convinced me, and the next question became ‘who do I want to embark on this journey with?’ Then several people I know and trust mentioned that I should look into NCA when I was thinking about this in late 2021.”</span></p><blockquote><p style=\"margin-left:0px;text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"background-color:transparent;font-size:14px;\">George eventually chose the NCA program because it offered support at multiple levels. “I liked that NCA helped manage and build an investor base from the start,” he explained. “I was not alone in securing funds and finding high-quality investors to support me in my search. Secondly, one of my biggest strengths is in operations, so I like the idea of having a very experienced partner, especially for the financial modeling and acquisition phase, where NCA’s support was really important to me. That was a key factor.”</span></p></blockquote><h4 style=\"margin-left:0px;text-align:justify;\"><strong>CLOSING THE DEAL</strong></h4><p style=\"margin-left:0px;text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"background-color:transparent;font-size:14px;\">George joined NCA in spring 2022 with an analytical, strategic approach he had honed at McKinsey, along with logistics and team-building mastery after many years at Deutsche Post DHL. After less than one year of searching, George found what he was looking for in SEYSES, a Spain-based company that serves its clients – mostly leading players in the renewable energy sector – in the mitigation of risks and the management of responsibilities derived from subcontracting, with owned operations in Spain, Mexico, Chile, Panama, Colombia and Brazil.</span></p><blockquote><p style=\"margin-left:0px;text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"background-color:transparent;font-size:14px;\">George was introduced to the company owners through a broker. “When I first met the founders,” he said, “I spent the whole meeting trying to convince them not to sell because I believed they could achieve the professionalization they wanted without selling. That ended up being a good start to our relationship because I was being honest and they could see I had their best interests at heart.”</span></p></blockquote><p style=\"margin-left:0px;text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"background-color:transparent;font-size:14px;\">George continued: “The deal was interesting because it was not really a typical search, but it was perfect for me. The company was relatively young with young founders who are very good at what they do. They had ambitious plans for growth, but they needed a leader with the necessary experience to help them scale up. And that’s what I’ve been doing my whole life. I have a long history of transforming large, multinational corporations, so I complement the company’s leadership very well.”</span></p><blockquote><p style=\"margin-left:0px;text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"background-color:transparent;font-size:14px;\">George’s acquisition process was complex, as SEYSES is composed of 7 legal entities in 6 different countries. Due diligence and contract negotiations took around six months, but in some ways that had its advantages, explains George. “While that was going on, we were also getting to know each other better, thinking about what kind of company we were going to build and how to work together as a team. We wrote the company’s change story together.”</span></p></blockquote><figure class=\"image image-style-align-left image_resized\" style=\"width:35.89%;\"><img style=\"aspect-ratio:1024/768;\" src=\"https://explorelogicsit.net/nca/portal/media/George_SEYSES-6-1024x768_1702562296.jpg\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\"></figure><p style=\"margin-left:0px;text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"background-color:transparent;font-size:14px;\">As he reflected on his journey, George had some advice to share for other ETA searchers. He had started his search with a focus on logistics companies based in Spain, but realized there were very few companies that met all of his criteria. “When I saw logistics wasn’t yielding the promising base I had expected, I quickly began exploring my other search areas, notably engineering services, which is where I found what I was looking for. So I think the lesson there is that while having an industry focus is good, especially for fundraising and getting started, it’s best if you can combine that with some flexibility and an opportunistic attitude as you start to go deeper into your search.”</span></p><blockquote><p style=\"margin-left:0px;text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"background-color:transparent;font-size:14px;\">When asked how he feels now, as he steps into his new role as CEO of SEYSES, George said he was looking forward to tapping into his skills and experience to take SEYSES to the next level. “I am eager and excited to get started,” he said. “I’ve been working very closely with the founders and the target company for months, and my mind is almost completely in the first 100 days already, focusing on how to ensure we have a good start. I have the energy and drive to do something big and I consider myself very fortunate to have been given this opportunity.”</span></p></blockquote><p style=\"margin-left:0px;text-align:center;\"><span style=\"background-color:transparent;color:rgb(229,114,0);font-size:14px;\">***</span></p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"background-color:transparent;font-size:14px;\">For more information about George, please visit: </span><a href=\"https://www.novastone-ca.com/searcher-waldemar-en.php\"><span style=\"background-color:transparent;font-size:14px;\"><strong>https://www.novastone-ca.com/entrepreneurs.php</strong></span></a></p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"background-color:transparent;font-size:14px;\">For more information about SEYSES, please visit: </span><a href=\"https://seyses.com/es/en/\"><span style=\"background-color:transparent;font-size:14px;\"><strong>SEYSES.com</strong></span></a></p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"background-color:transparent;font-size:14px;\">For more information about NCA, please visit: </span><a href=\"https://novastone-ca.com/index.php\"><span style=\"background-color:transparent;font-size:14px;\"><strong>https://novastone-ca.com/index.php</strong></span></a></p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;text-align:justify;\">Visit his LinkedIn page here: <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/george-berczely/\"><strong>https://www.linkedin.com/in/george-berczely/</strong></a></p>', '2023-12-14 13:58:40', '2023-12-15 07:49:14');

He would go on to work for Shell for 15 years, an experience that forged Will’s professional foundation and was backed by many growth opportunities, including being able to complete a BEng in Marine and Mechanical Engineering at Northumbria University.</p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;text-align:justify;\">Will moved into entrepreneurial ventures and spent the next decade running a series of businesses for himself and for foreign investors. In 2013, he became one of three Founding Partners of Capro, a corporate advisory firm, and in 2016, he and another Capro founder co-founded Orbitt, a fintech investment platform that matches investors to investment opportunities. Will successfully completed three funding rounds at Orbitt, raising both equity and debt from Angel investors, VC’s, and strategic partners.</p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;text-align:justify;\">At that point in his career, Will had taken his strong corporate foundation and then built up experience working across equity, structured term debt, asset finance, working capital, and trade finance transactions. He began exploring other ways he could continue building on his current entrepreneurial path. In 2020, he began learning about Entrepreneurship through Acquisition and, in the process, discovered his next professional challenge.</p><h2 style=\"margin-left:0px;text-align:justify;\"><strong>DIVING INTO ETA</strong></h2><p style=\"margin-left:0px;text-align:justify;\">Will initially embarked on his search and acquisition journey on his own, but when he learned about NCA’s program a few months into his search, he realized his dream of acquiring a small UK business could evolve into something more.</p><blockquote><p style=\"margin-left:0px;text-align:justify;\">“I saw that partnering with NCA could make it possible for me to acquire a business at a much bigger scale and receive support throughout the ETA journey,” Will said. “That was attractive, especially the support in those aspects of the ETA process where I had limited experience, so I decided to apply for the program and have never looked back.”</p></blockquote><p style=\"margin-left:0px;text-align:justify;\">In late 2021, Will joined NCA, bringing with him a longstanding entrepreneurial track record and his solid 15-year, blue-chip multinational career. “The thought of merging my engineering and senior management experience, and applying it to a single SME business with great growth potential, was very exciting,” said Will.</p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;text-align:justify;\">Will focused his search on engineering services or light manufacturing companies based in the UK, and after 17 months he successfully closed his deal in April 2023, when he acquired Forza Doors Ltd., a leading UK supplier of fire-rate and non-fire-rated timber doors, panels, and doorframes used in commercial interior construction.</p><figure class=\"image image-style-side image_resized\" style=\"width:25.66%;\"><img style=\"aspect-ratio:1024/709;\" src=\"https://explorelogicsit.net/nca/portal/media/Will-Forza-Brand-3-1024x709_1702562451.png\" width=\"1024\" height=\"709\"></figure><blockquote><p style=\"margin-left:0px;text-align:justify;\">“It was actually slightly opportunistic,” Will explained, “I was primarily looking at engineering and engineering services but was also exploring manufacturing companies with significant owned IP, which is where Forza fit in very nicely. Forza Doors Ltd. is a fantastic business,” added Will, “and from the first moment that I started to learn about the company, it immediately felt like a good fit.”</p></blockquote><p style=\"margin-left:0px;text-align:justify;\">When asked to reflect on how it feels to have reached this stage of his journey and look ahead to what the future holds, Will said, “It’s still very much sinking in. We spent months focusing on the deal, which was a lot of work; you go from that intense work phase of finalizing the deal, to a sense of relief and achievement as the deal closes, to the realization that now the <i>real</i> work starts as you step into your new role.”</p><blockquote><p style=\"margin-left:0px;text-align:justify;\">“I’m excited to be stepping in, to get to know the business from the inside, and to integrate with the company’s strong, existing management team,” he added. “This is a long-term journey and potentially the last professional role I’ll ever have, so there’s a lot of mixed emotions, but mostly a lot of satisfaction and excitement in getting to this stage. I really look forward to the years ahead as we grow the business together.”</p></blockquote><h2 style=\"margin-left:0px;text-align:justify;\"><strong>LESSONS LEARNED: A BIT OF GOOD LUCK AND A LOT OF HARD WORK</strong></h2><p style=\"margin-left:0px;text-align:justify;\">In addition to the many support teams that are a crucial part of NCA’s ETA program, Will also highlighted the more indirect benefit of being part of a community of searchers. “The softer side is that connection you build with the other people in the program,” said Will. “Being able to pick up the phone and speak to other searchers who’ve already acquired and hear about their experiences of going through the deal process, or simply being able to talk to others who are going through the same experiences is really helpful for bouncing ideas, sharing learnings, and managing the natural ups and downs of the search.”</p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;text-align:justify;\">Will also called out succession challenges and the personal relationship he built with the business owners at Forza Doors as playing key roles in his search and eventual acquisition. “Succession challenges are very much a reality,” he said. “You hear about it before you start your search, but, as you go deeper, you start to identify a pattern in the reasons why businesses are coming to market for sale, and, very frequently, succession is a challenge as older owners are looking towards retirement.”</p><figure class=\"image image-style-align-left image_resized\" style=\"width:41.05%;\"><img style=\"aspect-ratio:2560/1927;\" src=\"https://explorelogicsit.net/nca/portal/media/Will-Forza-Truck-scaled_1702562468.jpg\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1927\"></figure><p style=\"margin-left:0px;text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"background-color:transparent;font-size:14px;\">He continued: “The owners and the Director at Forza Doors had built that business over 13 years. They were looking for a solution that allowed them to step back from the day-to-day business, but also they have a lot of vested relationships and respect for the team. They were really looking for the right new owners who would continue to live by the same values, the same kind of respect within the business, and of course, take the company forward and grow it from there with minimal disruption.”</span></p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"background-color:transparent;font-size:14px;\">“In my case, there was a competitive acquisition process with other potential buyers,” added Will. “I think one of the reasons we were selected was specifically because of the personal relationship we had built, and the fact that we brought both a solid transition of ownership and also new management they could get aligned with. So, I think in that respect, ETA definitely marries all of those components for everyone involved and brings those two sides together.”</span></p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"background-color:transparent;font-size:14px;\">When asked if he had advice for others considering launching a search fund, Will cautioned that there’s always uncertainties in the ETA process. “I didn’t close my first deal that we negotiated on and I looked at hundreds of opportunities,” he said. “I think that’s the thing: you just have to keep looking at the opportunities, getting out there, talking to people, and building those relationships. Then with a bit of good luck and a lot of hard work, it will fall into place.”</span></p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;text-align:center;\"><span style=\"background-color:transparent;color:rgb(229,114,0);font-size:14px;\">***</span></p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"background-color:transparent;font-size:14px;\">For more information about Will, please visit: </span><a href=\"https://www.novastone-ca.com/entrepreneurs.php\"><span style=\"background-color:transparent;font-size:14px;\"><strong>https://www.novastone-ca.com/entrepreneurs.php</strong></span></a></p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"background-color:transparent;font-size:14px;\">For more information about Forza Doors Ltd., please visit: </span><a href=\"https://www.forza-doors.com/\"><span style=\"background-color:transparent;font-size:14px;\"><strong>https://www.forza-doors.com/</strong></span></a></p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"background-color:transparent;font-size:14px;\">For more information about NCA, please visit: </span><a href=\"https://novastone-ca.com/index.php\"><span style=\"background-color:transparent;font-size:14px;\"><strong>https://novastone-ca.com/index.php</strong></span></a></p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;text-align:justify;\">Visit his LinkedIn page here: <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/will-hunnam-11877b28/\"><strong>https://www.linkedin.com/in/will-hunnam-11877b28/</strong></a></p>', '2023-12-14 14:01:20', '2023-12-15 07:47:31'),
(45, '1702562564.jpg', 'INSTILLING CONFIDENCE THROUGH LEADERSHIP WITH ENTREPRENEUR NICK AKERS', 'Entrepreneur Nick Akers closed his deal in May 2023 when he successfully acquired US-based STL Communications. We sat down with Nick to learn about his search journey and how Entrepreneurship Through Acquisition can help family owned businesses currently facing succession challenges.', 'instilling-confidence-through-leadership-with-entrepreneur-nick-akers', 1, 0, '<h2 style=\"margin-left:0px;text-align:justify;\"><strong>STRAIGHT FROM UNIVERSITY TO CEO</strong></h2><p style=\"margin-left:0px;text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"background-color:transparent;font-size:14px;\">Nick Akers was born and raised in the Midwest of the United States and became an entrepreneur very early in his career. While studying chemistry at Saint Louis University, Nick invented technology related to advanced materials and energy storage, which he then licensed from the university to start a venture capital funded company in 2003. “My very first professional step out of university was being the CEO of what was a small business at that time,” explained Nick. “I had to figure out everything involved in running a company, including recruiting and managing a board of directors, some of whom were also investors, so it was a fairly unique experience at a very young age.</span></p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"background-color:transparent;font-size:14px;\">His career took off and, after seven years as CEO, Nick moved into a series of executive roles at high technology companies, largely serving defense and commercial aerospace customers. In 2012, he became Managing Director of a specialty chemical company in Saint Louis, Missouri. “It was there that my leadership philosophies were really honed,” he said. “The company was a family business that had not gone through professionalization, so I led that process for them, which included recruiting and running its advisory board, establishing and tracking KPIs for the business, and implementing ways to transition the company to a data-driven decision making process.”</span></p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"background-color:transparent;font-size:14px;\">The results were significant, and Nick helped double the size of the company by spearheading and executing an international greenfield investment for a new chemical factory. Nick had also begun preparing an acquisition and value creation thesis, but the company ultimately decided to not engage in M&amp;A activity at that time. Nick realized he had achieved all that he could at that role and found himself ready for the next step in his career: he decided to move forward with the acquisition thesis he had already begun building.</span></p><h2 style=\"margin-left:0px;text-align:justify;\"><strong>A JOURNEY INTO ETA</strong></h2><p style=\"margin-left:0px;text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"background-color:transparent;font-size:14px;\">Nick began his search and acquisition journey on his own, never having heard of search funds before. As he went deeper in his research, he discovered NCA’s ETA program and decided to apply as a way to improve his chances of success. And that success was not far off: Nick joined NCA in late 2021, and his search came to a successful close in May 2023 with the acquisition of Missouri-based STL Communications, a Business Services Partner specializing in Voice, Networking, Storage and Managed Service/Cloud services (also known as Unified Communications as a Service, or UCaaS).</span></p><figure class=\"image image-style-side image_resized\" style=\"width:32.43%;\"><img style=\"aspect-ratio:449/498;\" src=\"https://explorelogicsit.net/nca/portal/media/journey-img_1702562545.jpg\" width=\"449\" height=\"498\"></figure><p style=\"margin-left:0px;text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"background-color:transparent;font-size:14px;\">While Nick originally began his search with a focus on proprietary deals, he ultimately connected with STL Communications through a broker. “I shared a bit about myself, the NCA program, and how we’re focused on situations where a succession issue is needing to be solved,” explained Nick. “That’s when the broker brought up this opportunity because that was exactly the case.”</span></p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"background-color:transparent;font-size:14px;\">Nick’s acquisition highlights how ETA can help solve the succession challenges facing many of today’s family-owned SMEs. “Succession is a very challenging topic, particularly at the first generation founder level,” Nick said. “These business owners created their companies from scratch, which is challenging and requires a lot of hard work and long hours. It’s only towards the end of the journey when things start becoming fun, when you’re making the most money and you have the most freedom, so I can understand why it’s hard to think about walking away from that.”</span></p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"background-color:transparent;font-size:14px;\">Nick continued: “Some owners are intentional about planning for succession and what they want to do with the business. But what I’ve often seen is that because thinking about succession is so difficult, it never gets addressed until something forces it, and then there’s a time restraint to come up with a viable solution. ETA can be a way to begin these discussions and give business owners time to develop personal relationships and the best path forward, both for themselves and for their companies.”</span></p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;text-align:justify;\">&nbsp;</p><h2 style=\"margin-left:0px;text-align:justify;\"><strong>WORDS OF WISDOM: ADVICE FOR OTHER SEARCHERS</strong></h2><p style=\"margin-left:0px;text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"background-color:transparent;font-size:14px;\">When asked if he had advice for others embarking on the ETA journey, Nick stressed thoroughly researching the journey in advance. “This isn’t just a next job, it’s a very different thing,” he said. “I suggest really spending the time and mental energy to think it through carefully before going down this path.”<img style=\"height:auto;\" src=\"http://insights.novastone-ca.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Nick-Akers-HR-20210902-D85_8618-1.jpg\" alt=\"Nick Akers CEO\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\"><img style=\"height:auto;\" src=\"http://insights.novastone-ca.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Nick-Akers-HR-20210902-D85_8618-1.jpg\" alt=\"Nick Akers CEO\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\"></span></p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"background-color:transparent;font-size:14px;\">Nick also highlighted the benefits of working with a broker during the search phase. “In the search fund space many of the potential companies are still first generation founder-owned and -operated,” he said, “so the advantage to working with a broker is that you know from the start that the seller is at least semi-serious because they’ve engaged with a broker. The broker will also help educate the seller throughout the purchase process, which can be very helpful to getting a deal done.”</span></p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"background-color:transparent;font-size:14px;\">Nick also called attention to the importance of having a strong support network. “Closing on a business is dynamic and can be very high stress,” he explained. “I’ve heard a number of searchers say they lean on their lawyers or their deal team as an outlet for their own stress. While having a reliable resource for that is important, I suggest it not be your deal team, because those are people you’re going to work with post-close; some of them may even end up being on your board.” Nick suggested leaning more on family, close friends, and other searchers as a better solution. “The NCA Entrepreneurs actively communicate amongst themselves for support and for sharing ideas,” he said. “That’s a valuable part of the program because searching can be very lonely, so it’s great to have a team of folks who you can have those types of discussions with.”</span></p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"background-color:transparent;font-size:14px;\">“Ultimately, I would offer that you need to start acting like the CEO pre-close,” Nick added. “I believe you need to demonstrate that you can handle the stress of closing if you want to instill confidence that you can handle running a business.”</span></p><h2 style=\"margin-left:0px;text-align:justify;\"><strong>LOOKING AHEAD</strong></h2><p style=\"margin-left:0px;text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"background-color:transparent;font-size:14px;\">As he steps into his new role at STL Communications, Nick says UCaaS is a fast growing market that presents huge opportunities, and he is ready to take on the challenge. “This deal is the culmination of a lot of hard work,” he said, “and having successfully reached this stage feels like the closing of one chapter and the beginning of a new, very exciting one. We finally get to do what really excites me, which is operating the business, leading great teams of people, creating a culture of high performance and high trust, and delivering helpful solutions for our customers. It’s a very exciting place to be.”</span></p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;text-align:center;\"><span style=\"background-color:transparent;color:rgb(229,114,0);font-size:14px;\">***</span></p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"background-color:transparent;font-size:14px;\">For more information about Nick, please visit: </span><a href=\"https://www.novastone-ca.com/entrepreneurs.php\"><span style=\"background-color:transparent;font-size:14px;\"><strong>https://www.novastone-ca.com/entrepreneurs.php</strong></span></a></p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"background-color:transparent;font-size:14px;\">For more information about STL Communications Inc., please visit: </span><a href=\"https://stlcom.com/\"><span style=\"background-color:transparent;font-size:14px;\"><strong>https://stlcom.com/</strong></span></a></p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"background-color:transparent;font-size:14px;\">For more information about NCA, please visit: </span><a href=\"https://novastone-ca.com/index.php\"><span style=\"background-color:transparent;font-size:14px;\"><strong>https://novastone-ca.com/index.php</strong></span></a></p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;text-align:justify;\">Visit his LinkedIn page here: <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/akersnick/\"><strong>https://www.linkedin.com/in/akersnick/</strong></a></p>', '2023-12-14 14:02:44', '2023-12-15 07:43:43'),
(46, '1702562642.jpg', 'SPOTLIGHT ON ENTREPRENEUR NATHAN TAYLOR: FROM MILITARY COMMANDER TO NCA CEO', 'Entrepreneur Nathan Taylor closed his deal in June 2023 when he successfully acquired US-based Water Runner Inc. We sat down with Nate to learn about his search journey and how his ability to stay hyperfocused and committed made all the difference in closing his deal.', 'spotlight-on-entrepreneur-nathan-taylor-from-military-commander-to-nca-ceo', 1, 0, '<h2 style=\"margin-left:0px;text-align:justify;\"><strong>A LOVE FOR SMALL TEAMS WITH OUTSIZED IMPACT</strong></h2><p style=\"margin-left:0px;text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"background-color:transparent;font-size:14px;\">Nathan “Nate” Taylor joined NCA’s ETA program in 2022 with wide-ranging experience in both the military and private sectors. The start of his career journey dates back to 2010, when he graduated from West Point United States Military Academy and began working for the United States Army. He worked as Assistant Director of Operations and then Aviation Company Commander, which had him leading a 111-member reconnaissance and surveillance flight company in conducting counter-terror operations across three continents.</span></p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"background-color:transparent;font-size:14px;\">After eight years with the military, Nate branched into the private sector with Merck &amp; Co, shifting his career focus into energy and sustainability. While working as the global energy procurement manager at Merck, Nate pursued a Master of Business Administration in sustainability (with an energy sub-focus) and enrolled at the Yale School of Management, where he learned about ETA from a fellow student and friend.</span></p><blockquote><p style=\"margin-left:0px;text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"background-color:transparent;font-size:14px;\">Nate was intrigued. “Every bit of information I learned reaffirmed that taking the leap into ETA was the right career choice,” he said, citing parallels between the business world and his military experience. “Even though the military is a huge bureaucratic organization, I was fortunate to be in a segment that operated in small teams. We’d take 10-20 people to remote parts of the world on a mission in support of national objectives with multinational partners. That kind of outsized impact with a small team resonated with me, so a big part of why I went into ETA was because I feel like small business entrepreneurship replicates many of the best parts of those experiences.”</span></p></blockquote><p style=\"margin-left:0px;text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"background-color:transparent;font-size:14px;\">Nate’s time in the military had also exposed him to a host of international influences, which played a role in his decision to join NCA’s ETA program. “The idea of forming a cohort of international investors and being supported by them was really appealing to me,” said Nate. “I like having an international perspective and international insights on doing business, and I felt that partnering with NCA offered that opportunity.”</span></p><figure class=\"image image-style-side image_resized\" style=\"width:27.98%;\"><img style=\"aspect-ratio:781/1024;\" src=\"https://explorelogicsit.net/nca/portal/media/TSQ_2315-Kopie-781x1024_1702562626.jpg\" width=\"781\" height=\"1024\"></figure><p style=\"margin-left:0px;text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"background-color:transparent;font-size:14px;\">Nate was also drawn to NCA’s streamlined processes and fundraising expertise. “When choosing a partner, I also wanted someone with deep financial experience, specifically someone who was versed in putting together deals, had in-house M&amp;A support, and could help secure investors and funding throughout the process. And that’s exactly what NCA has been,” he added.</span></p><h2 style=\"margin-left:0px;text-align:justify;\"><strong>CLOSING THE DEAL</strong></h2><p style=\"margin-left:0px;text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"background-color:transparent;font-size:14px;\">Nate kicked off his search in spring of 2022, focusing on infrastructure or utilities companies in the United States, and on June 13, 2023, he successfully acquired Water Runner Inc., a Texas-based company that purifies and delivers bulk potable water to residential and commercial customers throughout the Southwest United States.</span></p><blockquote><p style=\"margin-left:0px;text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"background-color:transparent;font-size:14px;\">When asked how he was able to complete his deal in such a relatively short time span, Nate credited staying hyperfocused on his search criteria. “It’s really important to maintain alignment with your family and your investors on what you’re searching for. The search and acquisition process has a binary outcome: either you get a deal done or you don’t,” he said. “The more focused you are, the higher your chances are of finding your ideal target company and closing a deal.”</span></p></blockquote><p style=\"margin-left:0px;text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"background-color:transparent;font-size:14px;\">When asked how it feels to have successfully closed his deal, Nate said it feels great and is hugely relieving. “There’s an innumerable amount of things to do each day that are engaging and important and require all my faculties – both creative and financial, both the left and right side of the brain – so I’m really enjoying it. I love being outside and working alongside our employees; the mechanics, drivers, the operators – the people that power our local economy,” he added. “I’ve only been at the helm for a short while but it’s been a really enjoyable learning process so far. I’m very excited to start building and see where this goes.”</span></p><h2 style=\"margin-left:0px;text-align:justify;\"><strong>WORDS OF WISDOM: STAY FOCUSED, TAKE THE LEAP</strong></h2><p style=\"margin-left:0px;text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"background-color:transparent;font-size:14px;\">Based on his own ETA experience, Nate recommends other searchers really hone in on what they are looking for and stick with it. “It’s kind of a paradox. You’d think that the wider the net you cast, the more optionality and opportunities you’d create for yourself,” said Nate. “But you’re actually making it more difficult to get a deal done. I think being constrained, focused and dogged about pursuing your specific search criteria lends itself to a higher chance of finding your ideal target company and closing a deal.”</span></p><blockquote><p style=\"margin-left:0px;text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"background-color:transparent;font-size:14px;\">“I was ready to get my deal done because I’d rather be a CEO for a year than search for another year,” added Nate. “I was the only potential buyer who dropped everything; I stopped searching, we sold our house and we moved to Midland (Texas), which created a lot of goodwill with the seller and gave me the motivation I needed to get this done. So I’d say once you are confident about the company being the right fit, and you’ve got a preponderance of investors who are supportive of the deal, take the leap and be laser focused on getting the deal done, even if it means dropping your search efforts for other opportunities,” he finished.</span></p></blockquote><p style=\"margin-left:0px;text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"background-color:transparent;font-size:14px;\">Nate also highlighted the importance of having a strong team of advisors, expressing his thanks to Paul Pryzant and James Dorough-Lewis of Seyfarth Shaw LLP, who worked around the clock to bring his complex transaction to a successful conclusion; UHY Advisors’ Nick Chambers and Patrick Stark for their invaluable advice, financial and tax diligence; NCA’s Taylor Perry for his excellent financial support as NCA’s M&amp;A lead in North America; NCA’s Director of Investor Relations Chris Meier, who accompanied Nate throughout the process and played a key role in helping him manage and communicate to his investor base; and NCA Co-Founder Christin Malek.</span></p><blockquote><p style=\"margin-left:0px;text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"background-color:transparent;font-size:14px;\">“As NCA’s Co-CEO, Christian stepped up at the most critical periods in the deal process to get us to a close,” said Nate. “His actions gave me extreme confidence in NCA as a program and organization. Having been through the entire process, from raising the search fund to closing a deal, I can wholeheartedly recommend the NCA program to any mid-career professional interested in ETA.”</span></p></blockquote><p style=\"margin-left:0px;text-align:center;\"><span style=\"background-color:transparent;color:rgb(229,114,0);font-size:14px;\">***</span></p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"background-color:transparent;font-size:14px;\">For more information about Nate, please visit: </span><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/nathanptaylor/\"><span style=\"background-color:transparent;font-size:14px;\"><strong>https://www.linkedin.com/in/nathanptaylor/</strong></span></a>&nbsp;<span style=\"background-color:transparent;font-size:14px;\">and </span><a href=\"https://www.novastone-ca.com/searcher-nathan.php\"><strong>https://www.novastone-ca.com/searcher-nathan.php</strong></a></p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"background-color:transparent;font-size:14px;\">For more information about Water Runner Inc., please visit: </span><a href=\"https://www.waterrunnerinc.com/services-1\"><span style=\"background-color:transparent;font-size:14px;\"><strong>https://www.waterrunnerinc.com/services-1</strong></span></a></p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"background-color:transparent;font-size:14px;\">For more information about NCA, please visit: </span><a href=\"https://novastone-ca.com/index.php\"><span style=\"background-color:transparent;font-size:14px;\"><strong>https://novastone-ca.com/index.php</strong></span></a></p>', '2023-12-14 14:04:02', '2023-12-15 07:56:18');
